# Remote jupyter Notebook

## Going back to the campus

First thing first, we need to go back to the network environment we used to, that is, the sos network.
A VPN is needed for this purpose.
The detail discription is in [here](http://jimubu.adm.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/public/index.php/VPN_connection_service), which support both Windows and Linux (sorry Mac; but maybe the same as Linux).

## ssh to your computer

This can be done easily by an ssh command.
However, we need to know the ip address of our desktop.
Fortunately (if you have registered your desktop in the system), you can check the ip address in [here](https://dhcp.adm.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/user/host).
As long as your computer is open, the ip address is usually fixed.
Even though it is changed, you can refresh the page to get the latest one.

Then you can try using `ssh your_accnount_name@your.ip.address` to test if everything goes well so far.
It should be.

## Open the jupyter notebook

Now open a terminal and ssh to your desktop, and then `cd` to the workplace where your notebooks are in.
This terminal is used to launch the jupyter notebook service and later we need another to ssh the link to our laptop.

In the first terminal, launch the service by `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889`.
We need to check if any token shows up after `http://localhost:8889/`.
If no, then you need to upgrade your anaconda or even reinstall the latest version (see below).

Then in the second terminal, do `ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 remote_user@remote_host`.
After entering the password, nothing should present.
Now you can open the browser and input http://localhost:8888/ to see if you can get to your familiar interface.
Of course, your will be required to enter the token - just copy that from the fitst terminal.
You can check the token of the opened notebooks using `jupyter notebook list`.
This certificate is necessary when we use the notebook remotely.
We can also set a password so we don't need to copy and paste the token every time - try `jupyter notebook passowrd`.
Once finished using the notebook, simply close the second terminal (this releases http://localhost:8888/) and then exit jupyter notebook in the first terminal using `Ctrl+C`.
If more than one notebook services is required, simply change the port number.

### Reinstall the latest anaconda

```sh
# Remove the anaconda file
rm -rf the/path/of/anaconda

# (optional) delete the path added in ~/.bashrc. Please do it manually and use vim to open .bashrc

# Download the latest anaconda
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Install anaconda
sh Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
# Then follow the prompts

# Don't forget to install your packages after this.
```

# Setting up bash on ubuntu on windows

## 安装bash on ubunto on windows

因为我已经装过了所以就随便在网上找了个[教程](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/)。应该能行。

## Jupyter Notebook的使用

我有的时候需要用jpynb控制bash来运行一些老掉牙的Frotran程序，而如果将anaconda装在win下就不能这么干了。搜了一下是可以在ubuntu中打开jpynb然后在win下的浏览器打开的：[看这里](https://medium.com/@sayanghosh_49221/jupyter-notebook-in-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-f075f7ec8691)。

然后其他Jpynb的控制就看[这里](https://mingjiejian.github.io/2018/01/29/jpynb/)。

## 挂载其他硬盘

要是我的数据在移动硬盘上面怎么办呢？Win下的Ubuntu默认只挂载C盘。这个时候就要[自己挂载了](https://superuser.com/questions/1114341/windows-10-ubuntu-bash-shell-how-do-i-mount-other-windows-drives)：

```bash
# 挂载
sudo mkdir /mnt/d
sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d

# 取消挂载
sudo umount /mnt/d
```

实测挂载之后把terminal关掉挂载也不会消失，可以挂载一次永久使用。
