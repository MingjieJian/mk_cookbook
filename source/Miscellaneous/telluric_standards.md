# Telluric standard stars

## How to find telluric standards?

> - Spectral appearance in the wavelength range considered
> - Proximity to the science target
> - Signal-to-noise ratio necessary for a sufficient correction
> - Binary nature of the target
(ref 1)


OV-BV: good but only a few;
BV-AV: Hydrogen line is strong, but can be removed easily;
GV: Hydrogen line weak, but other atomic line become strong; may can use solar spectra to correct;
FV: the edge of possible candidate.

Select stars whose airmass will be the same as the average airmass of the target when it is being observed.
(ref 2)

S/N: several times the S/N for target star.

## After selection check list

> - Does the star have an appropriate spectral type?
> - Is the star single with no notable variability?
> - Is the RA and airmass of the star appropriate for directly before and/or after science observations?
> - Does the magnitude of the star in the wavelength of interest provide sufficient signal in a short exposure time? (check this using the EMIR ETC)
> - Have you included corrections for the proper motion of the star?
(ref 1)
